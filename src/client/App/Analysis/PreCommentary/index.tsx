            Another day, another Wordle! The Wordle dictionary contains{' '}
            <strong>{remainingCount} words</strong>, and this tool considers{' '}
            <strong>{guessAnalysis.beforeRemainingCounts.common}</strong> of
            them to be 'common', or at least more common than the others.
            However, not all Wordle answers are common words.

          <p>
            The first play should aim to eliminate as many words as possible.
            The AI always plays "lares" which eliminates the most possibilities
            on average. But, the thing about averagesâ€¦ well let's just see what
            happens:

              Ok, this is tough. The trick here is realising that there are

              Definitely play one of the possible answers, preferably a common
              word, but as a contingency plan, maybe there's one that has a
              greater chance of eliminating more of the others?

              With this many answers still in play, it's probably best to try

              It's still early in the game. Try to eliminate as many answers as
              possible. This isn't 'hard mode', so avoid playing letters that
              you already know are (or aren't) in the answer.
